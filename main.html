      <h2><u><strong>About</strong></u></h2>

      <h3>What is Earth?</h3>
      <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
        While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, 
        only Earth sustains liquid surface water. 
        About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. 

        <br><br>

        Earth has been called the "Goldilocks planet." In the story of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," 
        a little girl named Goldilocks liked everything just right. 
        Her porridge couldn't be too hot or too cold. 
        And her bed couldn't be too hard or too soft. 
        On Earth, everything is just right for life to exist. 
        It's warm, but not too warm. 
        And it has water, but not too much water.

      <h3>Species</h3>
      <p>
        Scientists have estimated that there are around <strong>8.7 million species</strong> of plants and animals in existence. 
        However, only around 1.2 million species have been identified and described so far, 
        most of which are insects. This means that millions of other organisms remain a complete mystery. <br>

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>
        Earth consists of land, air, water and life. 
        The land contains mountains, valleys and flat areas. 
        The air is made up of different gases, mainly nitrogen and oxygen. 
        The water includes oceans, lakes, rivers, streams, rain, snow and ice. <br>
